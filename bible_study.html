<b><p>Main Themes</p></b>
<br>
<p>Paul seeks teach us five main Concepts:</p>
<br>
<p><u>1. God's purpose for us</u></p>
       <p>In God's eternal and loving plan, He directs and sustains our salvation. Such that when we respond to God's love and trust in Him, his purpose becomes our mission.</p>
<br>
<p><u>2. Christ is the center </u></p> 
<p>   Christ is the center, creator and sustainer of all creation. Since He is the center of everything, His power must be central to us and we should begin by placing our priorities under his control.</p>
<br>
<p><u>3. The living church under Christ</u></p>
<p>Paul describes the church Christ as a living body. We are part of that body, equiped with different gifts. We should therefore use our God-given abilities and gifts to equip and support other believers in Christ for the living church to function as envisaged by Christ. </p> 
<br>
<p><u>4. The new family </u></p>
<p>Christ paid the ransom for our redemption, such that we could be reconciled with him anew. Our sin have been forgiven and we have been brought near Christ. We are a new people, a new family under christ. We should continue living as a new people, treating one another with the same love and grace that Jesus showed to us when He stood in the gap for our redemption. </p>
<br>
<p><u>5. Christian way of life</u></p>
<p>Paul encourages us to a christian life that is full of wisdom and dynamism. The holy spirit of which we are equiped with helps us to live according this new standard. To utilize the Spirit’s power, we must lay aside our evil desires and draw on the power of his new life. Submit your will to Christ, and seek to love others.</p>

<p>Theme: God's Work of Individual Reconcialiation</p>
<br>
<p><u> Ephesians 2:8-10</u></p>
<br>
<p><i>"<sup>8</sup>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Not of works, lest any man should boast.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."</p></i>
<br>
<br>
<div class="design_20170216">
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>&#9679; <i>"For by grace are ye saved through faith;.."</i>: We are not even saved by our faith, but by grace through faith.</li>
  <li>&#9679; <i>"and that not of yourselves:.."</i>: We become Christians through God’s unmerited favor, not as the result of any effort, ability, intelligent choice, or act of service on our part.</li>
  <li>&#9679; <i>"it is the gift of God:..."</i>: If salvation was the accomplishment of man in any way, we could boast about it. But under God's plan of salvation, God alone receives the glory.</li>
  <li>&#9679; <i>"For we are His workmanship:.."</i>: Our salvation is something only God can do. It is his powerful, creative work in us. If God considers us his masterpieces, we dare not treat ourselves or others with disrespect or as inferior work.</li>
  <li>&#9679; <i>"created in Christ Jesus unto good works,.."</i>: Salvation first comes by grace that afterwards we might give ourselves to them.</li>
  <li>&#9679; <i>"..which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."</i>: That beautiful thing God is making of us is active in good works. These are just as much a part of God's predestined plan as anything else is. These good works are valid evidence that someone is walking as one of God's chosen.</li>
